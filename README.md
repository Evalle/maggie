This project was written in Python and it uses [Splinter library](https://splinter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

```
Itâ€™s important to note that you also need to have Google Chrome installed on your machine.

2) Then you need to clone current repository 
``` 
$ git clone https://github.com/Evalle/maggie.git
